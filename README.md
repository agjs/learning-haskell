# Learn you a Haskell for Good
#### by Miran Lipovača

* My private repository for saving some examples from the book I recently bought. Since this is my first experience with functional programming (other then playing with ramdajs and lodash in JS), I wanted to save all the examples to a repo so I can go back to it when I forget something. Functional programming is quiet different from imperative way we've been thought for so long so it takes time to adept.
